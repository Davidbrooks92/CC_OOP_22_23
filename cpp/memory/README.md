## week 2
* **hello.cpp** illustrates passing pointers to function and some hacky manipulation
* **sphere.cpp** calculating the area of a sphere, with memory created and release using **new** and **delete**

## week 3
* **smart.cpp** basic illustration of using smart pointers and passing data around
* **smart_sphere.cpp** using unique pointers to calculate area of a sphere
* **shared.cpp** illustrate shared pointers and a case when memory is never freed
* **shared_sphere.cpp** calculate area of sphere using shared pointers
* **copy_sphere.cpp** only allocates memory on stack and does a lot of copying values
* **pointer_sphere** aggresivly minimised memory usage and only uses memory on the stack
